# Destination Marketing Accreditation Program Certification

San Jose received its Destination Marketing Accreditation Program (DMAP) in 2010. The globally recognized DMAP certification serves as a visible industry distinction that defines quality and performance standards in destination marketing and management. Achieving DMAP accreditation positions a destination management organization (DMO) or CVB as a valued and respected organization in your community and increases your credibility among stakeholders.

The DMAP program is powered by Destinations International (DI), a travel industry collaborative association that conducts research, participates in advocacy, fosters talent development and create global engagement to elevate tourism to its highest potential.
